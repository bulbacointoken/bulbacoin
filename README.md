__Welcome to the Bulbasaur Token (BULBA)__, the best Pokemon Finance Protocol. Since you're just in time for our product launch, let's talk about our project, dreams, and goals for this community.


__First of all, what's so special about Bulbasaur?__
Well, this special Pokemon is born with a large seed firmly affixed to its back; the seed grows in size as the Pokemon does.

__Ok, so what?__
Well, the seed (BULBA) grows in size as our project will grow. Early investors are sure to benefit from the whole might of this amazing creature and project.

__Let's talk business - what is your Roadmap?__
__Q1-Q2 2021__ - List on PancakeSwap
__Q2-Q3 2021__ - NFTs regarding the whole Pokeworld that you can freely buy and sell, exactly the same that you would do with your PokeDEX
__Q3 2021__ - Bridge with ETH and Uniswap list.

__How do you insure my BULBA worth long term?__
First of all, 5% of tokens are burned during every transaction. This means that the whole supply is constantly decreasing. Think of this in comparison with Bitcoin that has a limited amount and that's it. Well, BULBA has a limited supply that is in constant deflation of total coins available. Long term holders will only benefit, because their wallet will be worth more and more over time.
